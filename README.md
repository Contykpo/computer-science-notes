# computer-science-notes

Notes and useful media related to subjects and fields of study in Computer Science (UBA)

IMPORTANT: Most subject study notes will be stored inside the Obsidian Vault '[Notes](https://github.com/Contykpo/introduction-to-algorithms/tree/main/Notes/)' until futures updates.
TO-DO: Consider to diversify the study notes by subject / field of study if the Obsidian Vault grows too large.
