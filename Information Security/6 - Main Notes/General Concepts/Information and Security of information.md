# Information:

Information refers to any communication or representation of knowledge as data, in any form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms, and in any medium, whether magnetic, on paper, on computer screens, audiovisual, or other.

Information can consist of documents, files, communications, systems, personal data, keys, any relevant data.

## Security of Information:

Information security is understood as the preservation of the following characteristics:

#### - Confidentiality:

Ensures that the information is **accessible** **only to those authorized** to have access to it.

For example: Encrypting a tax return will prevent anyone from reading it. If the owner needs to see it, they must decrypt it with the key that only they know. If someone manages to obtain the encryption key, the confidentiality of the tax return has been compromised.

#### - Integrity:

The **accuracy** and **completeness of the information** and **processing methods** are **safeguarded**. Integrity includes both the integrity of the data (the content) and their origin.  

For example: A newspaper may provide information obtained from the Casa Rosada but attribute it to an incorrect source. This is an example of information integrity, but with corrupted source integrity.

Types of integrity:

- **Data integrity**: we trust that the transport or storage medium does not alter the information.
- **Origin integrity**: when the information is about the origin of something or about identity.

#### - Availability:

Ensures that authorized users have access to the information and related resources whenever they need them.

For example: It is the last day of enrollment at the university, and a power outage occurs that lasts the entire day. The UPS systems work for 2 hours and then shut down the servers. Result: The late students are unable to enroll in their courses.

Types of availability:

- **Traditional**: access to the information is either granted or not.  
- **Quality of service**: there is a committed level of service (SLA) that must be met.

#### - Authenticity:

Essential for maintaining trust and preventing unauthorized access. It involvesÂ **verifying the origin of data, ensuring its genuineness, and providing confidence in its validity**.
