# Prevention:

#Prevention Means that the attack **will** fail. For example, if someone tries to access a system through the Internet, but the system is not connected to that network, the attack has been prevented.

# Detection:

Can be used when an attack **cannot be prevented** or to measure the effectiveness of prevention mechanisms. #Detection mechanisms assume that an attack will occur, and their goal is to report attacks that take place.

# Recovery:

#Recovery is the main objective **after** an attack has occurred, **actions are taken to stop it**. Damage must be determined and repaired, and normal operation restored. Example: If an attacker deletes a file, it can be recovered from backups.
