# Risk Assessment

#Risk-Assesment is understood as the **evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities** related to information and its processing facilities, the probability of their occurrence, and their potential impact on the organizationâ€™s operations.

## Human Factor:

Implementing information security controls is complex, and in a large organization, the controls can become vague or inconvenient.

If they are configured improperly or used incorrectly, even the best security controls become useless and, in some cases, even dangerous.

Untrained personnel can be a threat to the security of a system. Example: An operator who does not know that they must verify the contents of backups before storing them.

The necessary training is not only technical. Many successful attacks come from the use of #Social-Engineering. For example: If operators change access passwords through phone requests, all an attacker needs is to know the name of one of the system users and make a call.
