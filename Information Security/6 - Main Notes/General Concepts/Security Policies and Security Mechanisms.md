# Security Policy:

A #Security-Policy is a statement of what is allowed and what is not.
In general, policies require some procedures that technology alone cannot enforce.

# Security Mechanism:

A #Security-Mechanism is a **method**, **tool**, or **procedure** used to *enforce* a #Security-Policy.
**Mechanisms** can be non-technical. For example: Requiring a student ID before changing a studentâ€™s password.

# An Operational View:

Any useful #Security-Policy and #Security-Mechanism must **balance** the **benefits of protection** with the **cost** of designing, implementing, and using the mechanism.

This balance can be determined by analyzing the risks and the probability of occurrence. 
For example: A database provides employee salary information and is used to print paychecks. If this information is altered, the company could suffer significant financial losses. Therefore, it is clear that mechanisms must be used to ensure the integrity of the information. However, if there is a second system that daily copies this database to each branch so they have reference values when hiring new staff (the decision is made by the headquarters), the need to maintain integrity at each branch is not as critical.
