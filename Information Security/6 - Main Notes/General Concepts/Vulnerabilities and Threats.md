# Vulnerability:

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in an asset.

# Threat:

A **threat** is a potential security violation. The violation does not need to occur for the threat to exist. Threats “exploit” vulnerabilities.

One must protect against or be prepared for actions that could cause such a violation.  

Such actions are called #Attacks. Those who carry out these actions, or cause them to be carried out, are called **attackers** or **intruders**.

##### Origin:

Threats can have either **Intentional / Accidental**, or **External / Internal** origins.

## Types of Threats:

#### Interruption of the Flow of Information:

Threatens the #Availability of the information. And it can be produced by:

- **Destruction** of resources.
- **Blocking** of resources.
- **Saturation** of resources.

#### Interruption of Information:

Threatens the #Confidentiality of the information. And it can be produced by:

- **Unauthorized Access** to resources.
- **Monitoring** of Information.
- **Social Engineering** #Social-Engineering.

#### Alteration of Information:

Threatens the #Integrity of the information. And it can be produced by the **Modification** of resources.

#### Fabrication of Information:

Threatens the #Authenticity of the information. And it can be produced by:

- **Incorporation** of fake information.
- **Phishing**: Delivery of fake messages.

## Passive Threats:

- No interference with systems. 
- Difficult to detect. 
- Depend on the physical transmission medium.
- Data monitoring ( #Sniffing ).
- Activity analysis ( #Side-Channel-Attack ).

## Active Threats:

– Information capture ( #Keylogger ).
– Identity spoofing ( #Spoofing ).
– Message retransmission .
– Data falsification ( #Tampering ).
– Port scanning. 
– Exploitation of vulnerable software ( #Exloit ).
– Interception ( #Man-in-the-Middle ).
– Denial of service ( #DoS ).
