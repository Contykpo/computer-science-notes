# Covert Channel

A #Covert-Channel is a communication mechanism that was not designed to be used for that purpose.

For example: **Directory problem and solution in DG/UX B2.**

**Objective:** Preserve the data and its integrity.

To establish an **integrity policy**, it is necessary to identify the authorized ways in which information can be altered and which entities are authorized to make those alterations.

**Covert channels** are addressed by:

- [[BIBA Model]].
- [[Clark-Wilson Model]].

## Operation Principles:

**Separation of duties**: For example, moving a system from the development environment to the production environment.

**Separation of functions**: For example, systems are programmed and tested in the development environment, not in production.

**Auditability**: For example, the process of moving a system to production must be audited; auditors must have access to the systemâ€™s state and logs.
