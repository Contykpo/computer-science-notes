# Chinese-Wall

**The #Chinese-Wall solves problems like the following:**

- Armando is a market analyst who advises **Banco Mayo** on corporate business plans.  
- He is also asked to advise **Banco Junio** on the same topics.  
- A #Conflict-of-Interests arises, because having internal information from one bank, such as plans, financial status, etc., could give him an advantage in how he advises the other.

Because the **Chinese Wall**:

- Organizes entities into **“conflict of interest” classes**.
- Controls **subject access** to each class.
- Controls **writing** to all classes to ensure that information is not passed from one to another in violation of the rules.
- Allows everyone to see **“sanitized” information** (for example, public financial statements).

#### Some Definitions:

**Objects**: Information elements related to a company.

**Company dataset (CD)**: Contains objects related to a company – written as **CD(O)**.

**Conflict of Interest Class (COI)**: Contains datasets of companies that compete with each other.
- Written as **COI(O)**.
- It is assumed that each object belongs to only one COI class.
