# Types of Access Control

**Objective**: To control who accesses the system, who accesses the system’s resources, and how they access them.

There are two well defined areas:

## System Access Control

**Objective**: to allow access to the system only to authorized users.

A mechanism is used that consists of two steps:
- **Identification**: the user tells the system who they are.
- **Authentication**: the system verifies the user’s identity.

## Resource Access Control

**Objective**: to establish which users can access the different resources provided by the system and in what way they can do so.

There are two main rules:
- Resources must be accessed only by authorized users, that is, those with explicit permissions.
- Actions on the resources must be those allowed for those users.

## Access Control Techniques

Access control techniques are generally classified into:

- DAC: [[Discretionary Access Control]].
- MAC: [[Mandatory Access Control]].
- RBAC: [[Role-Based Access Control]].
- ABAC: [[Attribute-Based Access Control]].
- ReBAC & Google Zanzivar: [[Relationship-Based Access Control]].
