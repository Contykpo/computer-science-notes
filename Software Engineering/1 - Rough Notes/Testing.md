- Testing can prove the existence of errors by failures, but never their absence.
- Testing can't prove that the software program works correctly.

#### Domain-Partition Technique:

- **Heuristic**: Partition the domain of inputs in disjoint subsets or complete sets.
	- Keywords error and unique indicate input sets in order to avoid the combination of same inputs.

# Black-Box Testing

We ignore the internal structure of the program, that is, its code, but not its specification.
