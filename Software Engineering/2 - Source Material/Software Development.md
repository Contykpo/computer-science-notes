## What is Software Development?

- **Something unique and particular**.
- Best analogy: **Similar to a learning process**.

Acquisition of Knowledge -> Representation of Knowledge.
Representation of Knowledge -> Acquisition of Knowledge.

## The Process of Software Development:

Software Development is a learning process, this implies that:

- The process is iterative.
- The process is incremental.
- Knowledge is generated from concrete facts.
- Generated knowledge must be organized.

#### Characteristics of Software Development:

- The #Problem-Domain is usually specified in ambiguous and contextual languages ​​(e.g. natural language).
- The development process involves **disambiguating** and **decontextualizing** knowledge of the #Problem-Domain .
- The development process involves making explicit and externalized the implicit and internalized knowledge from the domain experts.
- **Change** is an essential feature of software, it is not accidental because:
	- Changes the #Problem-Domain.
	- Changes our understanding of the #Problem-Domain.
	- Changes the way of modeling our understanding of the #Problem-Domain.

#### Conclusion:

- Software = #Computable-Model.
- Software Development = Learning Process.
	- Iterative.
	- Incremental.
	- Immediate Feedback.
- Software Engineering is based on those fundamentals.
