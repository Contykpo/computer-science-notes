## Engineering: The Practical Application of Science.

Software development is a process of discovery and exploration; therefore, to be successful at it, software engineers must become experts at learning.

Humanity's best approach to learning is science, so we must adopt the techniques and strategies of science and apply them to our problems. This is often misinterpreted to mean that we must become physicists by measuring things to unreasonable levels of precision, in the context of software. Engineering is more pragmatic than that.

What I mean when I say that we must apply the techniques and strategies of science is that we must apply some fairly basic, but nevertheless extremely important, ideas.

Wikipedia describes the scientific method that most of us learned in school as:

- **Distinguish**: Make an observation of the current state.
- **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Believe in a description, a theory that can explain your observation.
- **Predict**: Make a prediction based on your hypothesis.
- **Experiment**: Test your prediction.

**Software Engineering** is the application of an empirical scientific approach to finding economical and efficient solutions to practical software problems.

Taking an engineering approach to software development is important for two main reasons:
**First**, software development is always an exercise in discovery and learning.
**Second**, if our goal is to be “**efficient**” and “**economical**,” then our ability to learn must be sustainable.
This means that we must manage the complexity of the systems we create in ways that maintain our ability to learn and adapt to new things.

So, we need to become <u>experts at learning</u> and <u>experts at managing complexity</u>. There are five techniques that form the roots of this approach to learning. Specifically, to become experts at learning, we need the following:

- Iteration.
- Commenting.
- Incrementalism.
- Experimentation.
- Empiricism.

“In **science** if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. In **engineering** if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it”
