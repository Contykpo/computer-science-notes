## Peter Naur

Programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or archive a certain kind of insight, a **theory**, of the matters at hand.
This suggestion is in contrast to what appears to be a more common notion, that programming should be regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.

### Ryle's Notion of Theory

Ryle introduced the idea that theory, in the context of intellectual activity, is more than just possessing factual knowledge ("knowing that"). It involves "knowing how"—the ability to perform tasks intelligently and to justify, explain, and respond to questions about those tasks. In Ryle’s view, being intelligent in an activity is not about following a set of rules or methods; rather, it is about the ability to apply one's understanding in a flexible and context-sensitive manner. This involves:

- **Performing tasks intelligently**: Doing something well, according to certain criteria, and being able to learn and adapt.
- **Building and possessing a theory**: Having an in-depth understanding that allows one to explain, justify, and discuss the activity, beyond merely performing it.

### Application to Programming

Naur argues that programming involves building a theory—specifically, a theory of how the program addresses and interacts with the real-world activities it is meant to support. According to Naur, the knowledge programmers must acquire and develop goes beyond what can be documented in program texts or specifications. It includes a deeper understanding of how the program maps to real-world phenomena and why certain design decisions were made.

### Key Aspects of Programmers’ Theory:

1. **Explanation and Mapping**: The programmer must understand and explain how the program corresponds to real-world activities. This involves knowing which parts of the world are relevant to the program and how these are represented in the program code.
    
2. **Justification of Design**: The programmer must justify design decisions, not only by referring to formal rules or methods but also through direct, intuitive knowledge of the program's purpose and the problem it solves.
    
3. **Handling Modifications**: When modifying a program, the programmer’s understanding of the similarities between new requirements and the existing program is crucial. This understanding cannot be fully captured by documentation or rules; it depends on the programmer's deep, theoretical knowledge of the program.

### Implications of the Theory Building View

Naur's view challenges the idea that programming is merely a process of creating and modifying text. Instead, it suggests that the most crucial part of programming—the theory cannot be fully documented or transferred via text alone. This has several implications:

- **Program Life and Death**: The "life" of a program depends on the programmers who understand its theory. When the original programmers leave, the program "dies" because the theory is lost. Reviving a dead program by reconstructing its theory is a challenging and costly process.
- **Program Modification**: Effective modifications rely on the programmer’s grasp of the theory. Without this, modifications can degrade the program’s quality, leading to "patchwork" solutions that diverge from the original theory.
- **Educational Challenges**: Educating new programmers in an existing program's theory requires more than just reading documentation. It involves mentoring and hands-on experience with the program in the context of real-world problems.
