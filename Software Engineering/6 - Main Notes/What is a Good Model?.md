# Good Model

#### Functional Axis:
Everything that can be observed and accurately represented on a model.

#### Descriptive Axis:
The model must be as much descriptive as possible.

#### Implementation Axis:
The model must be as much efficient as possible. The must model must present **isomorphism**, which means the relationship between the #Computable-Model and the #Problem-Domain has to be ideally **One-to-One**. That is because if the **model** where to add extra concepts outside of the **domain**, then **the model wouldn't be teaching you to learn from the the domain**.

(Remember that #Software-Development is like a **learning process**, the #Computable-Model must teach you about the #Problem-Domain).

It is best when the model represents the observable from the domain, but without over-simplifying the concepts inside the domain.
