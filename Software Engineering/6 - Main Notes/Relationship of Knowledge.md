# Relationship of Knowledge

For an object to collaborate with another, it must know the name of that other object.
We can think of the #Relationship-of-Knowledge as a **variable**, which is name given to an object at a certain time.

- It is the relationship that exists between objects.
- Objects must be named by the their specific **role** at the time they are being named.
- It is possible that an object could be known by the different names between different objects, even the same object could know itself differently than the other objects.
