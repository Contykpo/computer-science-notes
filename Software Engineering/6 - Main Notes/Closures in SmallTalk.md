# Closures  / Anonymous Functions / Lambdas:

In Small-Talk, closures are objects that represent code by encapsulating collaborations between brackets '[ ]'. And since they are objects, they can be assigned to variables.

A special feature of closures in Smalltalk, Ruby, Self is that they implement 'Non Local Return' which means that the execution context can be enhanced inside the closures, such that it cannot be returned later in the same method.
