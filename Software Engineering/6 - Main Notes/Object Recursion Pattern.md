# Object Recursion Pattern

Similar to the Composite Pattern, it can also be thought of as the pattern of taking the if statements out of a recursive method and representing each if abstraction in a polymorphic object. For example, one object for the base case, and another object representing the recursive implementation of the method. The objects implement the method, but with different abstractions.
