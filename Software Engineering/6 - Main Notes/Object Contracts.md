# Contracts Between Objects

#Object-Contracts are conditions that must be met when two **objects** collaborate with each other. Those conditions can be divided between pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants.

- **Pre-conditions**: Conditions that must be met before running a method. And they mostly verified with #Complete-Object s  or before initializing. 
- **Post-conditions**: Conditions that must be met after running a method or function.
- **Invariants**: Conditions that must be always met during the whole lifetime of a class instance.

When #Object-Contracts are breached, the results of such breach are known as #Exceptions.
