# Composite Structural Design Pattern

The #Composite-Pattern  is a structural pattern used to represent a hierarchy of objects in a tree structure. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Advantages:

- Simplifies client code since it treats individual objects and composites in the same way.
- Makes the system easier to extend by adding new components (leaves or composites) without affecting existing code.
- Provides flexibility in handling complex tree structures and compositions.
- **Uniform Treatment**: Both individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites) are treated the same way through the interface, making the code flexible and scalable.

# Composite Structure

#### Component Interface:

Defines the common interface for both individual objects (leaves) and composites (composite nodes.
Describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree.

#### Leaf:

Represents the individual objects that do not have any children.
Usually, leaf components end up doing most of the real work, since they don’t have anyone to delegate the work to.

#### Composite / Container:

Represents a node that contains children. It implements the component interface and delegates operations to its child components.
A container doesn’t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface.
Upon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final result to the client.

#### Client:

The **Client** works with all elements through the component interface. As a result, the client can work in the same way with both simple or complex elements of the tree.

# Example Use Case

In a **graphical user interface (GUI)** system, you might have components like buttons, text boxes, and containers. Containers can hold other components, which may be buttons or more containers. Using the Composite Pattern, each element (whether it's a button or a container) can be treated the same way, simplifying operations like rendering the interface or handling user input.
